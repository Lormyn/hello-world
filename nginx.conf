# Simple Nginx configuration that listens directly on port 8080.

# Basic Nginx settings (optional, but good practice)
# The events block is top-level
events {
    worker_connections 1024; # Adjust as needed
}

# The http block contains settings related to handling HTTP requests
http {
    # Include standard MIME types
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    # Other common settings
    sendfile        on;
    keepalive_timeout  65;
    # gzip            on; # Uncomment to enable compression

    # --- The server block MUST be INSIDE the http block ---
    server {
        # Nginx will listen directly on port 8080.
        listen 8080; # This line is likely around line 18-20 in this structure

        # Define the root directory for static files.
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;

        # Specify the default file to serve.
        index index.html;

        # Basic location block to serve files.
        location / {
            # Try to serve the requested file directly, or fallback to index.html
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
        }

        # Optional: Add headers for security or caching if needed later.
        # Example: add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=3600";
    }
    # --- End of server block ---

    # You could potentially have other server blocks here inside http {}

}
# --- End of http block ---
